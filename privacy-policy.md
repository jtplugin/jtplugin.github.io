## 2. Scope of This Policy

This Policy applies to personal data we receive from third-party marketplaces in connection with the download, trial activation, purchase, or licensing of our plugin(s).

It does not apply to data processing activities carried out independently by third-party marketplaces such as Autodesk. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information about how they process your data.

## 3. Data Collected by the Plugin

Our plugin operates locally within Autodesk Fusion.

We *do not* collect, transmit, monitor, or store:

* User project files
* Design content
* Technical drawings
* Usage analytics
* Personal data directly from within the software environment

The plugin does not send user data to external servers controlled by us.

---

## 4. Personal Data Received from Third-Party Marketplaces

When you download, install, evaluate, or purchase our plugin via a third-party marketplace (such as Autodesk Marketplace), we may receive limited information from that marketplace, including:

* Full name (as provided to Autodesk)
* Email address
* Purchase or download status
* License or entitlement information
* Transaction reference information (where applicable)

We do not collect additional personal data beyond what is provided by the marketplace.

---

## 5. Purpose of Processing

We process the personal data described above solely for purposes directly related to the plugin you installed or evaluated, including:

* Communicating important product-related updates
* Informing users of pricing changes
* Providing license or entitlement information
* Responding to technical support requests
* Managing software lifecycle communications

These communications are limited to matters strictly related to the relevant plugin and do not include unrelated third-party marketing.

Users may request information, clarification, or updates at any time by contacting:

**[jtplugin@ajldata.it](mailto:jtplugin@ajldata.it)**

---

## 6. Legal Basis for Processing

Where GDPR applies, our legal basis for processing this personal data is our **legitimate interest** in:

* Operating and maintaining our software products
* Informing users of material changes affecting pricing or licensing
* Ensuring transparency regarding product conditions
* Providing necessary customer support

We have assessed that these interests are not overridden by users’ fundamental rights and freedoms, as:

* The data processed is limited and proportionate
* The communication is directly related to the installed or evaluated product
* Users may object at any time

---

## 7. Data Retention

We retain marketplace-provided personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to:

* Manage licensing and entitlements
* Provide support
* Communicate relevant product-related updates

Personal data is securely deleted or anonymized when it is no longer required for these purposes.

---

## 8. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Access to personal data is restricted to the minimum necessary for product management and support purposes.

---

## 9. International Data Transfers

If personal data is processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

---

## 10. Your Rights

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another jurisdiction providing similar rights, you may have the right to:

* Request access to your personal data
* Request rectification of inaccurate data
* Request erasure of your data
* Request restriction of processing
* Object to processing based on legitimate interest
* Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

To exercise any of these rights, please contact:

## 11. Objection to Communications

You may object at any time to receiving product-related communications by contacting:

**[jtplugin@ajldata.it](mailto:jtplugin@ajldata.it)**

Upon objection, we will cease sending further non-essential product communications.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
